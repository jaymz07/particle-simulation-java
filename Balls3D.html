<applet code = "Balls3D.class" width=1120 height=600> </applet>
<font color=#00FF00><br><br>Now with solid polygons and rudimentary lighting!<br>Very slow however...  Use key "F" to turn on and off fancy graphics</br><br><a href="Balls3D_gallery.html">Screenshot Gallery!<a/><br><h1>Keyboard Commands</h1><br>W,A,S,D --- Move around<br>Page Up, Page Down --- move up or down (hover)<br>Arrow Keys --- Rotate<br>R --- randomly place sphere<br>Backspace --- Remove last added sphere<br>Space --- Change Type of Sphere to Place<br>Q --- Delete All Spheres<br>C --- Clear Paths and Field Lines<br>Z --- Make all velocities zero<br>I --- Change Integration Mode (RK-4/Forward Euler)<br>P --- Generate n-Pendulum...n determined by Counter (adjusted by keys 9 and 0)....Initial Velocity of bottom sphere determined by "Initial Velocity" slider...
<br>T --- Generate Spinning Top (detail determined by Counter, adjusted by keys 9 and 0)...Counter should be 7 or less<br>V --- Draw Electric Vector Field<br></foreground>M --- Show/Hide menu<br>F1 --- Show preformance stats<br>F2 --- Show coordinate axes<br>F3 (SLOW) --- Generate Electric Field Lines (Turn on/ off)....hit twice (turn on then back off) for best preformance...still very slow<br>F4 (SLOW and Buggy) --- Generate Equipotential Surfaces<br>F6 --- Generate grid/membrane - dimensions controlled by counter (adjusted by keys 9 and 0)...cannot be run with "Gravity", only "Downward Grav"...Center sphere given value of "Initial Velocity" slider
<br>F11 --- Hide/Show links<br>F12 --- Show/Hide Spheres<br>Num Pad 9/3 --- Double/Half size of universe<br>Num Pad 7/1 --- Adjust Size of Spheres<br>Num Pad 6/4 --- Adjust detail of spheres<br>Num Pad 8/2 --- Double/Half WASD speed<br>9/0 --- Adjust Counter Variable (used for pendulums, membranes, etc)<br>1/2 --- Adjust Path Length<br>3/4 --- Adjust Path Draw Interval (3=more detail/slower 4=less detail/faster)<br>7/8 --- Adjust Link Color Sensitivity<br>
<br>If applet appears too big, hit CTRL-0 to zoom to normal....if that doesn't work, CTRL-minus or CTRL-(mouse wheel down)<br><br>Author......James Bounds<br><br><br></font>
